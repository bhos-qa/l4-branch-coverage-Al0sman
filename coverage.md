Learning Outcomes:

1. A white box testing technique called "statement coverage" makes sure that each statement in a program is run at least once. It is a fundamental kind of code coverage that may be used to find unneeded code and confirm that every step of a program has been tested.

2. A more sophisticated type of code coverage called branch coverage makes sure that every conceivable result of every conditional branch in a program is run at least once. This covers both loops and conditional statements (like if and else commands).

3. Predicate coverage, a subset of branch coverage, makes assurance that a program evaluates all feasible Boolean conditional combinations. This assures that every potential path through a conditional statement is examined, making it more precise than branch coverage.
